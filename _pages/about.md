I am Haomin Zhuang, an undergraduate majoring in [Software Engineering](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/sse/) in [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/).

This year, I am a research intern in LSU remotely guided by [Prof. Wang](https://intellisys.haow.ca/haowang/) in [IntelliSys Lab](https://intellisys.haow.ca/). In 2021, I was a research assistant participating [SRP program](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/sse/2018/0615/c16846a270817/page.htm) in SCUT advised by [Dr. Feng](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/sse/2018/0615/c16790a270770/page.htm). In August 2021, I was a software developer intern at [Kinthtech](https://www.kinthtech.com/#/home).

My research interests are in the security of machine learning, distributed machine learning and privacy of machine learning. I want to further develop my understanding in mathematics and theory in machine learning and explore practical machine learning algorithm.
