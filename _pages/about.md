I am Haomin Zhuang, an undergraduate majoring in [Software Engineering](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/sse/) in [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/).

In 2023, I was a research intern in [OPTML group](https://www.optml-group.com/) in MSU advised by [Prof. Sijia Liu](https://lsjxjtu.github.io/). In 2022, I was a research intern in LSU remotely guided by [Prof. Wang](https://intellisys.haow.ca/haowang/) in [IntelliSys Lab](https://intellisys.haow.ca/). In August 2021, I was a software developer intern at [Kinthtech](https://www.kinthtech.com/#/home).

My research interests are in the robustness of machine learning, distributed machine learning and adversarial attack.

During leisure time, I have a wide range of interests, such as photography, basketball and singing.
