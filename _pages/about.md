I am Haomin Zhuang, a second-year Ph.D. student in [MINE Lab](https://mine-lab-nd.github.io/) advised by Prof. [Xiangliang Zhang](https://sites.nd.edu/xiangliang-zhang/). My academic background includes a Bachelor degree in [Software Engineering](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/sse/) from [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/).

I was a research intern in [OPTML group](https://www.optml-group.com/) advised by [Prof. Sijia Liu](https://lsjxjtu.github.io/) and [IntelliSys Lab](https://intellisys.haow.us/) guided by [Prof. Hao Wang](https://www.stevens.edu/profile/hwang9).

My research interests include large language models (LLMs), AI safety, and advancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs. I am particularly focused on model substructures and embeddings, aiming to improve their efficiency, interpretability, and alignment with human reasoning.
