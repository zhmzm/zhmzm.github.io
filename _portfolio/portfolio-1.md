[Prof. Wang](https://intellisys.haow.ca/haowang/), I independently accomplished this research as a research intern remotely. By exploring the relationship between models and backdoor task, we propose a new backdoor attack method, which can bypass SOTA defense strategies and inject backdoor effectively.

As the first writer, I finish the writing of this paper, which is under review in AAAI.
