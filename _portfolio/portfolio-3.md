Many sellers are unfaimilar to the products in their company Xiaopeng. However, they are facing detailed questions including comparison with other cars from customers in phonecall. How to build a high-quality answer database and how to match questions and answers are two main difficulties in this software. We finally crawled data from professional car information provider-Dongchedi website and trained a fine-turning multi-label classifer from Chinese-Bert. To our surprise, the model was able to understood sentences and even matched the word "oil consumption" to "power consumption" label, when "oil consumption" did not appear in our training dataset, because all cars in Xiaopeng are powered by electricity.<br/><img src='/images/xiaopeng.png'>
