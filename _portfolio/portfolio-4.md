title: "Project: A Cloud Service Accelerates Complex Coputation In Mobile Phone"
excerpt: "We develop a cloud service deploying in our server and an APP computing face recognition task. And we further explore how to minimize the running time by using cloud service. <br/><img src='/images/wbb.jpg'>"

With the development of Deep Learning, larger models are shown more precise and stable. However, it is not practical to deploy those large models in mobile phone, which slow down not only the app but also the phone. We try to explore which parts of computation calculated by cloud service can minimize the running time. For example, we can preprocess pictures in mobile phone then calculate it in cloud service, so reduce the size of pictures and computation time of large models. Our final goal is to design a system can recognise the computation method that are quickest dynamicly according to fluctuating network and changing computation speed of server. <br/><img src='/images/jiagou.jpg'>
