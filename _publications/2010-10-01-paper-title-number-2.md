excerpt: 'Blockchain was originally designed as a peer-to-peer network to handle cryptocurrency transactions. And with the advent of smart contracts, more and more applications are using Blockchain as an infrastructure. The smart contract provides a mechanism to automatically execute code according to programmed conditions without requiring other reliable third-party intervention. However, smart contracts have a nonnegligible limitation in that they can only operate on data that is on the Blockchain. This is why we need trusted entities called oracle which is in charge of writing external data into Blockchain. To avoid security issues such as malicious oracles writing incorrect data on Blockchain. This paper introduced a decentralized oracle based on reputation and incentive mechanism. To evaluate the feasibility and reliability of the proposed scheme, a simulation-based experiment was conducted. The results showed that our solution can well defend against attacks and penalize those malicious oracles.'
